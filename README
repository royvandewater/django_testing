BUILD:

    Open the project in eclipse, rightclick the project in the Package Explorer and select "Export". Export the plugin as "Plug-in Development"->"Deployable plug-ins and flagments" and save it to whatever directory you like.


INSTALLATION:

    Place the generated com.royvandewater.django_testing_x.jar file into your eclipse plugins directory (it was ~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_3.5.0_x/plugins/). 


USAGE:

    Place the cursor anywhere within a python file containing Django tests and press Alt+Shift+F11. If your cursor is currently inside of a specific test method, it will run only that method. If it is outside any test methods but still within the class, the plugin will execute all test methods in that class. Lastly, if you are in a function where the name is not prefixed with "test", the plugin will execute the last run test. This is great for writing a test and running it from another file as you write the implementation.
